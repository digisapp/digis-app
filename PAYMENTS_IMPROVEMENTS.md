# Payments System Improvements

## Summary of Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Endpoint Mismatch ✅
- Changed `/create-payment` → `/create-intent` to match frontend
- This fixes the 404 errors from `ImprovedTokenPurchase.jsx`

### 2. Fixed Schema Mismatches ✅
- Changed all `fan_id` → `member_id` to match database schema
- This fixes query failures that were causing 500 errors

### 3. Added Retry Logic ✅
- Created `retryHelper.js` utility with exponential backoff
- Database operations retry on transient errors (connection timeouts)
- Stripe operations retry on network/rate limit errors
- 3 retries with exponential delays (1s, 2s, 4s)

### 4. Created Withdrawals Table ✅
- Added migration `022_create_withdrawals_table.sql`
- Includes proper indexes and constraints
- Added missing columns to users table:
  - `withdrawn_amount`
  - `bank_account`
  - `auto_withdraw_enabled`
  - `stripe_account_id`

### 5. Standardized UUID Usage ✅
- All queries now properly cast `supabase_id` as UUID
- Prevents type mismatch errors in PostgreSQL

### 6. Fixed Response Structure ✅
- Added `clientSecret` at top level for frontend compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with `ImprovedTokenPurchase.jsx`
- Includes full payment and paymentIntent objects for flexibility

## Files Modified

1. **`/backend/routes/payments.js`**
   - Updated endpoint name
   - Fixed column names
   - Added retry logic
   - Fixed UUID casting

2. **`/backend/utils/retryHelper.js`** (NEW)
   - Retry utility with exponential backoff
   - Separate functions for DB and Stripe retries
   - Smart error detection for retriable errors

3. **`/backend/migrations/022_create_withdrawals_table.sql`** (NEW)
   - Creates withdrawals table
   - Adds missing user columns
   - Includes proper indexes

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Frontend now correctly calls:
const response = await fetchWithRetry(
  `${VITE_BACKEND_URL}/api/payments/create-intent`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      paymentMethodId,
      amount,
      // ... other fields
    }),
  }
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run the migration** in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   -- Run migration 022_create_withdrawals_table.sql
   ```

2. **Test payment flow**:
   - Purchase tokens through `ImprovedTokenPurchase.jsx`
   - Verify payment intent creation succeeds
   - Check that retries work with network throttling

3. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Disconnect network briefly to test retry logic
   - Use Stripe test cards for various failures

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Network errors now retry automatically
2. **Compatibility**: Schema matches database exactly
3. **Type Safety**: UUID casting prevents PostgreSQL errors
4. **Completeness**: All referenced tables now exist
5. **Performance**: Retry logic prevents cascading failures

## Next Steps

Consider implementing:
1. Redis caching for payment history
2. Webhook signature validation
3. Bank account encryption
4. Async withdrawal processing with Bull queue
