# Supabase Storage Implementation for Live Stream Recordings

## Overview
Successfully implemented Supabase Storage for saving and monetizing live stream recordings at 1080p resolution. The system integrates with Agora.io Cloud Recording API to capture streams and stores them in Supabase Storage for long-term access.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `/backend/migrations/030_create_stream_recordings.sql`
- Created `stream_recordings` table for saved recordings metadata
- Created `recording_purchases` table for tracking purchases
- Implemented RLS policies for secure access control

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- **File**: `/backend/routes/recording.js`
- `/api/recording/streams/:streamId/start-recording` - Starts Agora cloud recording at 1080p
- `/api/recording/streams/:streamId/stop-recording` - Stops recording and uploads to Supabase
- `/api/recording/streams/:streamId/save-recording` - Saves recording metadata with monetization options
- `/api/recording/recordings/:recordingId/purchase` - Handles token-based purchases
- `/api/recording/my-purchases` - Lists user's purchased recordings
- `/api/recording/creator/:creatorId/recordings` - Lists creator's public recordings

### 3. Frontend Components

#### SaveStreamModal.js
- Updated to upload thumbnails to Supabase Storage
- Integrates with backend save-recording endpoint
- Supports free and paid access types
- Progress indicator for upload status

#### StreamControlBar.js
- Added recording toggle button with visual indicators
- Shows "LIVE REC" badge when recording
- Start/stop recording controls

#### StreamingDashboard.js
- Integrated recording state management
- Automatic recording stop on stream end
- Recording data passed to SaveStreamModal
- API calls to start/stop recording endpoints

#### EnhancedRedeemTab.js
- Added "Stream Recordings" category
- Purchase recording functionality
- Integration with token balance
- Direct video playback links after purchase

### 4. State Management
- **File**: `/frontend/src/stores/useStore.js`
- Added recording state (isRecording, recordingId, etc.)
- Saved/purchased recordings tracking
- Recording action handlers

### 5. Configuration
- Added Agora Cloud Recording credentials to `.env.example`
- Supabase Storage already configured via environment variables
- Created SQL script for Supabase bucket setup

## How the Recording Process Works

### Starting a Recording
1. Creator clicks "Record" button in StreamControlBar
2. Frontend calls `/api/recording/streams/:streamId/start-recording`
3. Backend acquires Agora recording resource
4. Starts cloud recording at 1080p (1920x1080, 30fps, 4000kbps)
5. Recording ID stored in database

### Stopping a Recording
1. Creator clicks "Stop REC" or ends stream
2. Frontend calls `/api/recording/streams/:streamId/stop-recording`
3. Backend stops Agora recording
4. Downloads recording from Agora temporary storage
5. Uploads MP4 file to Supabase Storage bucket
6. Returns public URL for the recording

### Saving for Monetization
1. SaveStreamModal opens after stream ends
2. Creator sets title, description, thumbnail
3. Chooses access type (Free or Paid with token price)
4. Recording saved to `stream_recordings` table
5. Available in creator's content library

### Fan Purchase Flow
1. Fans browse recordings in EnhancedRedeemTab
2. Click purchase on paid recording
3. Tokens deducted from balance
4. Recording URL provided for immediate viewing
5. Purchase recorded in database

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd backend
npm run migrate
```

### 2. Create Supabase Storage Buckets
Run the SQL in `CREATE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKETS.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Add to your `.env`:
```bash
# Backend
AGORA_CUSTOMER_KEY=your_agora_customer_key
AGORA_CUSTOMER_SECRET=your_agora_customer_secret

# Frontend (already configured)
VITE_USE_SUPABASE_STORAGE=true
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install  # node-fetch already installed
```

## Storage Details

### Supabase Storage Structure
```
stream-recordings/
├── {streamId}/
│   ├── {timestamp}_1080p.mp4  # Recording file
│   └── thumbnails/
│       └── {timestamp}.jpg    # Thumbnail image
```

### File Specifications
- **Resolution**: 1080p (1920x1080)
- **Frame Rate**: 30 fps
- **Bitrate**: 4000 kbps
- **Format**: MP4 and HLS
- **Max File Size**: 5GB per recording

### Storage Costs
- Supabase provides 1GB free storage
- Additional storage: $0.021/GB/month
- Bandwidth: 2GB free, then $0.09/GB

## Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Creators can only manage their own recordings
   - Purchased recordings accessible only to buyers
   - Public recordings viewable by all

2. **Token-Based Purchases**
   - Atomic transactions with balance checks
   - Creator receives tokens immediately
   - Purchase history tracking

3. **Access Control**
   - Authenticated endpoints for recording management
   - Public endpoints for browsing recordings
   - Secure file URLs from Supabase

## Monitoring & Analytics

Recording events are logged and can be monitored via:
- Database `recordings` table for Agora recording status
- `stream_recordings` table for saved recordings
- `recording_purchases` table for monetization tracking
- Socket.io events for real-time notifications

## Future Enhancements

1. **Quality Options**
   - Add 720p and 480p options for bandwidth savings
   - Adaptive bitrate recording

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Automatic highlight generation
   - Chapter markers for long recordings
   - Recording analytics dashboard

3. **Storage Optimization**
   - Implement compression before upload
   - Archive old recordings to cheaper storage
   - CDN integration for global distribution

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Won't Start
- Verify Agora Customer Key/Secret are configured
- Check stream is active before starting recording
- Ensure sufficient Agora cloud recording minutes

### Upload Fails
- Verify Supabase Storage bucket exists
- Check file size doesn't exceed 5GB limit
- Ensure SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is configured

### Playback Issues
- Confirm recording URL is publicly accessible
- Check video format compatibility (MP4)
- Verify purchase was successful for paid content
