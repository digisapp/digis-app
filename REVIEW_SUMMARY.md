   - Status: ❌ Not done yet

2. **Add Socket Room Handlers** (5 minutes)
   - File: `/backend/api/index.js`
   - Add room join/leave logic for tips broadcasting
   - Status: ❌ Not done yet

3. **Create Frontend Components** (10 minutes)
   - BuyTokensSheet.jsx (code ready to paste)
   - TipButton.jsx (code ready to paste)
   - LiveTipsOverlay.jsx (code ready to paste)
   - Status: ❌ Not created yet

4. **Update MobileVideoStream** (10 minutes)
   - Add imports for tip components
   - Add socket room join/leave
   - Add components to JSX
   - Status: ❌ Not updated yet

5. **Run Database Migration** (1 minute)
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -f backend/migrations/009_create_pro_monetization.sql
   ```
   - Status: ❌ Not run yet

### Important (Can Do Later)

6. **Add Environment Variable** (1 minute)
   - Add `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to `.env`
   - Status: ⚠️ Missing

7. **Set Up Billing Cron Job** (5 minutes)
   - Configure Vercel Cron or QStash
   - Call `/api/billing/meter` every 30 seconds
   - Status: ⚠️ Not configured

## 💰 Revenue System

### Token Purchase (Digis Revenue Source)
```
User buys 100 tokens for $9.99
├─ Digis receives: $9.99
├─ Digis cost: ~$0.05
└─ Digis margin: $9.94 ✅
```

### Ticket Purchase (Private Show)
```
Fan pays 500 tokens
├─ Creator gets: 500 tokens (100%)
└─ Platform fee: 0 tokens

Creator cashes out:
500 tokens → $25.00 USD (1 token = $0.05)
```

### Pay-Per-Minute Call (30s blocks)
```
Rate: 100 tokens/minute
Every 30s:
├─ Fan charged: 50 tokens
├─ Creator gets: 50 tokens (100%)
└─ Platform fee: 0 tokens

If fan balance < 50: Call auto-ends
```

### Tipping
```
Fan sends 250 tokens
├─ Creator gets: 250 tokens (100%)
└─ Platform fee: 0 tokens
+ Socket broadcast to all viewers
+ Animated overlay shows tip

Creator cashes out:
250 tokens → $12.50 USD (1 token = $0.05)
```
