---

## 🗄️ Step 1: Run Database Migration

### Option A: Run Production Migration (Recommended)

1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lpphsjowsivjtcmafxnj/sql/new
   ```

2. Open the file:
   ```
   /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app/MANUAL_MIGRATION_V2_PRODUCTION_READY.sql
   ```

3. Copy the entire contents and paste into SQL Editor

4. Click **"Run"**

5. You should see success messages:
   ```
   ✅ Production-ready payout system migration completed successfully!
   📊 Tables created: payout_batches, payout_items, withdrawal_requests
   🔍 Views created: creator_payout_history, payout_batch_summary
   ⚙️  Functions created: get_creator_earnings_summary, get_eligible_creators_for_payout
   🔔 Triggers: Auto-update timestamps and batch statistics
   ```

### Verify Migration Success

Run this query to verify tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name IN ('payout_batches', 'payout_items', 'withdrawal_requests')
  AND table_schema = 'public';
```

You should see all 3 tables listed.

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### Vercel Backend Environment Variables

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Backend Project → Settings → Environment Variables

2. Verify these are already set (by Inngest integration):
   - ✅ `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` (auto-set by Inngest)
   - ✅ `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` (auto-set by Inngest)

3. Add these additional variables:

| Variable | Value | Environment |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `CRON_SECRET` | `40180ab69b86ff2a0346af5ea3ac00523cc66211d4c6a92fda7682f0179e7095` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres.lpphsjowsivjtcmafxnj:JWiYM6v3bq4Imaot@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://lpphsjowsivjtcmafxnj.supabase.co` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImxwcGhzam93c2l2anRjbWFmeG5qIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTI1NDg5ODQsImV4cCI6MjA2ODEyNDk4NH0.QnkIphnDGyB5jsO1IEq3p2ZQYSrRbPhXI8Me9lnC-SM` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | `sk_test_YOUR_STRIPE_KEY_HERE` | Production, Preview, Development |
| `TOKEN_TO_USD_RATE` | `0.05` | Production, Preview, Development |

**Important**: Change to production Stripe key when going live!

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

### Deploy Backend

```bash
cd /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app/backend
git add .
git commit -m "Add production-ready payout system with Inngest + UI fixes"
git push origin main
```

Or deploy directly:

```bash
cd /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app/backend
vercel --prod
```

### Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app/frontend
git add .
git commit -m "Fix UI issues: self-following, dropdown closing, Calls navigation"
git push origin main
```

Or deploy directly:

```bash
cd /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app/frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Verify Deployment

After deployment:

1. Check Vercel Dashboard → Your Backend Project → **Cron Jobs**
   - You should see: `/api/cron/payouts` scheduled for `0 2 1,15 * *`

2. Check Inngest Dashboard → Functions
   - You should see:
     - `create-payout-batch`
     - `process-payout-chunk`
     - `retry-failed-payouts-v2`
     - (plus legacy functions)

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Testing

### Test 1: UI Fixes (Frontend)

1. **Login as Creator** (Miriam)
2. **Go to Followers page**
   - ✅ Miriam should NOT appear in her own followers list
3. **Click Profile Dropdown → Calls**
   - ✅ Should navigate to Call Requests page
4. **Open and close Profile Dropdown on different pages**
   - ✅ Should close properly when clicking outside or pressing Escape
5. **Click on a follower's username**
   - ✅ Should navigate to their public profile page

### Test 2: Manual Payout Trigger (Backend)

Test the Vercel Cron endpoint manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/cron/payouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 40180ab69b86ff2a0346af5ea3ac00523cc66211d4c6a92fda7682f0179e7095" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payout batch queued for processing",
  "eventId": "...",
  "dayOfMonth": 10,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T02:00:00.000Z",
  "note": "Processing will continue in background via Inngest"
}
```

If not on 1st or 15th:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "skipped": true,
  "reason": "Not a scheduled payout day (1st or 15th)",
  "dayOfMonth": 10
}
```

### Test 3: Check Inngest Dashboard

1. Go to Inngest Dashboard → Events
2. You should see the `payout.create-batch` event
3. Click on it to see the execution steps
4. Verify all steps completed successfully

### Test 4: Withdrawal Request Flow

As a creator with balance:

```bash
# 1. Check earnings
curl -X GET https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/tokens/earnings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREATOR_TOKEN"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "earnings": {
    "totalEarned": 5000,
    "availableBalance": 3000,
    "bufferedEarnings": 500,
    "kycVerified": true,
    "canWithdraw": true,
    "nextPayoutDate": "2025-11-01"
  }
}

# 2. Request withdrawal
curl -X POST https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/tokens/request-withdrawal \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tokenAmount": 2000}'

# 3. View withdrawal requests
curl -X GET https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/tokens/withdrawal-requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CREATOR_TOKEN"
```

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### How It Works

```
1. VERCEL CRON (Every 1st & 15th at 2 AM)
   │
   ├─> Triggers: POST /api/cron/payouts
   │   └─> Sends Inngest event: "payout.create-batch"
   │       (Returns immediately - <100ms)
   │
2. INNGEST: create-payout-batch Function
   │
   ├─> Step 1: Create batch record (idempotent via batch_hash)
   ├─> Step 2: Query eligible creators (KYC + balance checks)
   ├─> Step 3: Create payout_items (idempotent via idempotency_key)
   ├─> Step 4: Enqueue chunks (25 creators per chunk)
   │   └─> Sends events: "payout.process-chunk"
   │
3. INNGEST: process-payout-chunk Function (Runs in parallel, max 5 concurrent)
   │
   ├─> For each payout item:
   │   ├─> Lock row (FOR UPDATE)
   │   ├─> Create Stripe transfer (idempotent via idempotency_key)
   │   ├─> Update payout_item status
   │   ├─> Create ledger entry (withdrawal_completed)
   │   └─> Commit transaction
   │
   └─> Check if batch complete → Mark batch as "completed"
```

### Key Features

1. **Idempotency**: Same event = same result (no duplicate payments)
   - `batch_hash`: Prevents duplicate batch creation
   - `idempotency_key` (batch:creator): Prevents duplicate payout items
   - Stripe idempotency key: Prevents duplicate Stripe transfers

2. **Reliability**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
   - Each step retries independently
   - Failed items marked for retry
   - Daily retry job for persistent failures

3. **Scalability**: Chunked processing
   - 25 creators per chunk
   - Max 5 chunks processing concurrently
   - Prevents API rate limits

4. **Consistency**: Database transactions
   - FOR UPDATE locks prevent race conditions
   - Ledger entries atomic with payout updates
   - Triggers auto-update batch statistics

5. **Observability**: Full audit trail
   - Every step logged in Inngest
   - Batch status tracked in real-time
   - Error messages captured for debugging

## 🔔 Monitoring & Alerts

### Inngest Dashboard

Monitor payout processing:
1. Go to https://app.inngest.com
2. View **Functions** → `create-payout-batch`, `process-payout-chunk`
3. Check execution status, duration, errors

### Vercel Dashboard

Monitor cron jobs:
1. Go to Vercel → Your Project → Logs
2. Filter by `/api/cron/payouts`
3. Check execution times and results

### Database Queries

Check batch status:
```sql
-- View recent batches
SELECT * FROM payout_batch_summary ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- View batch details
SELECT * FROM creator_payout_history WHERE batch_id = 123;

-- Check for failed payouts
SELECT * FROM payout_items WHERE status = 'failed';
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cron job not running

**Check**:
1. Vercel → Settings → Cron Jobs → Verify schedule
2. Vercel → Logs → Search for "cron"
3. Verify `CRON_SECRET` is set

**Fix**: Redeploy backend to refresh cron configuration

---

### Issue: Inngest functions not appearing

**Check**:
1. Inngest Dashboard → Functions → Should see 3 V2 functions
2. Verify `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` and `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` are set

**Fix**: Deploy backend again, Inngest auto-discovers functions

---

### Issue: Payouts failing

**Check**:
1. Inngest → Function runs → View error logs
2. Database: `SELECT * FROM payout_items WHERE status = 'failed'`
3. Verify creator has `stripe_connect_account_id`
4. Check Stripe dashboard for transfer errors

**Common Causes**:
- Creator missing Stripe Connect account
- Insufficient Stripe balance
- Creator's Stripe account not active
- Network timeouts (will auto-retry)

---

### Issue: Duplicate payouts

**Shouldn't happen** (idempotency prevents this), but if it does:

1. Check for duplicate `batch_hash` values:
   ```sql
   SELECT batch_hash, COUNT(*) FROM payout_batches GROUP BY batch_hash HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

2. Check for duplicate `idempotency_key`:
   ```sql
   SELECT idempotency_key, COUNT(*) FROM payout_items GROUP BY idempotency_key HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

3. If duplicates found, contact support (this indicates a bug)
