# Mobile Sign-In Fix - Rollout Guide

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. Black Screen in Portrait Mode
- **Problem**: After signing in as Creator, iPhone showed black loading screen in portrait
- **Cause**: CSS rendering bug where white background wasn't applied correctly
- **Fix**: Added inline `backgroundColor` style and explicit dark mode override

### 2. Tutorial Only Visible in Landscape
- **Problem**: Onboarding tutorial appeared black in portrait but worked in landscape
- **Cause**: Same rendering bug - rotation triggered re-render that fixed it
- **Fix**: Improved container styling + temporarily disabled onboarding

### 3. "We'll be right back" Error After Tutorial
- **Problem**: After completing onboarding, app crashed with error screen
- **Cause**: Main app tried to render before user data was fully loaded
- **Fix**: Added safety checks and proper loading states

## ✅ Changes Made

### Core Fixes

1. **`MobileOnboarding.js`** - Fixed black screen
   - Added inline white background style

3. **`ErrorBoundary.js`** - Enhanced debugging
   - Always log errors (not just in dev mode)
   - Added route, viewport, and user agent to logs
   - Added "Show error details" option in production
   - Added "Clear Data & Restart" button

### Hardeners (Production-Ready)

4. **`useIosVhFix.js`** - New hook
   - Fixes iOS Safari 100vh bug (address bar issue)
   - Handles orientation changes with 300ms delay
   - Updates on resize and keyboard open/close

   - Used as Suspense fallback
   - Animated spinner with pulsing dots

6. **`MobileErrorBoundary.js`** - New component
   - Lightweight error boundary for mobile routes
   - Touch-optimized UI
   - Logs viewport, orientation, and path for debugging
   - Suggests rotation to fix layout issues

7. **Environment Flag** - `VITE_MOBILE_ONBOARDING_ENABLED`
   - Default: `false` (onboarding disabled)
   - Can be toggled instantly via Vercel env vars (no redeploy)
   - Added to `.env`, `.env.example`, and `.env.production`

## 📋 Quick Validation (iPhone)

### Phase 1: Immediate Testing
1. ✅ Sign in as Creator (portrait) → no black screen, lands on dashboard
2. ✅ Rotate to landscape and back → UI stays visible (no flicker)
3. ✅ Kill Safari tab → re-open → still good
4. ✅ Check console for any red errors

### Phase 2: Edge Cases
1. ✅ Sign out → sign back in → verify no cached state issues
2. ✅ Sign in as Fan → verify explore page works
3. ✅ Test on both iOS 16 and iOS 17 if possible
4. ✅ Test on different screen sizes (iPhone SE, Pro Max)

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deploy
- [x] All changes committed and pushed
- [x] Build passes locally (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Test on physical iPhone (portrait + landscape)
- [ ] Test on physical iPhone (Fan and Creator roles)

### Deploy
```bash
# From project root
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel (automatic if connected to Git)
```

### Post-Deploy
- [ ] Test production site on iPhone (digis.cc)
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check Sentry for any new error reports
- [ ] Monitor first 100 mobile sign-ins

## 🎚️ Re-Enabling Onboarding (Later)

When ready to re-enable the tutorial:

### Method 1: Vercel Environment Variable (Instant, No Redeploy)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `VITE_MOBILE_ONBOARDING_ENABLED` = `true`
3. Redeploy (takes ~2 minutes)

### Method 2: Code Change (Requires Deploy)
1. Update `.env.production`:
   ```bash
   VITE_MOBILE_ONBOARDING_ENABLED=true
   ```
2. Commit, push, deploy

### Testing After Re-Enable
1. Clear localStorage on iPhone
2. Sign in as Creator
3. Verify white background appears immediately
4. Complete all 4 tutorial steps
5. Verify dashboard loads correctly after tutorial

## 🔍 Debugging New Issues

### If Black Screen Returns
1. Check browser console (Safari DevTools)
2. Look for CSS transform on parent elements
3. Verify background color is being applied
4. Check z-index conflicts

### If "We'll be right back" Appears
1. Open error details (now available in production UI)
2. Check console for:
   - `❌ Current Path:` - which page crashed
   - `❌ Viewport:` - screen dimensions
   - `❌ Component Stack:` - which component failed
3. Check Sentry dashboard for full stack trace

### If App Won't Load at All
1. User should try: **"Clear Data & Restart"** button
2. This clears localStorage and redirects to home
3. If still broken, have them:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Quit Safari completely
   - Restart phone (last resort)

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these in first 48 hours after deploy:

- **Sign-in Success Rate** (mobile): Should be >98%
- **Error Boundary Triggers**: Should be <1%
- **"Clear Data & Restart" Button Clicks**: Monitor for patterns
- **Sentry Mobile Errors**: Should decrease significantly

## 🎛️ Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

### Instant Rollback (Env Flag)
1. Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables
2. Set `VITE_MOBILE_ONBOARDING_ENABLED` = `false` (already default)
3. Redeploy (~2 minutes)

### Full Rollback (Git)
```bash
git revert HEAD~7  # Revert to before fix
git push
# Vercel auto-deploys
```

## 💡 Key Technical Details

### Why Onboarding Was Disabled
The onboarding component works correctly in isolation, but has a CSS rendering race condition on iOS Safari in portrait mode. Rather than risk blocking users, we:
1. Fixed the underlying rendering bugs
2. Disabled onboarding by default
3. Made it toggleable via env flag
4. Added comprehensive error logging

This approach:
- ✅ Unblocks users immediately
- ✅ Allows us to fix the root cause properly
- ✅ Enables instant re-enabling when ready
- ✅ No user data loss or bad UX

### iOS Viewport Fix Explained
iOS Safari's viewport height includes the address bar, causing layout issues. Our fix:
1. Calculates true viewport height (`window.innerHeight`)
2. Stores as CSS custom property (`--vh`)
3. Updates on resize and orientation change
4. Provides fallback with `100dvh` (modern browsers)

### Error Boundary Strategy
We now have two error boundaries:
1. **MobileErrorBoundary**: Lightweight, mobile-specific, touch-optimized
2. **ErrorBoundary**: Full-featured, works on both mobile and desktop

Mobile routes use MobileErrorBoundary for better UX.
