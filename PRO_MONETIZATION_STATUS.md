## 🔨 REMAINING TASKS (5%)

### 1. Create Frontend Components (10 minutes)

Just copy/paste these from `PRO_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`:

- [ ] `/frontend/src/components/payments/BuyTokensSheet.jsx` (ready to paste)
- [ ] `/frontend/src/components/payments/TipButton.jsx` (ready to paste)
- [ ] `/frontend/src/components/overlays/LiveTipsOverlay.jsx` (ready to paste)

### 2. Update Existing Files (5 minutes)

**A) Backend Server (`/backend/api/index.js`)**
Add socket room handlers and route mounting (code provided in guide)

**B) MobileVideoStream (`/frontend/src/components/mobile/MobileVideoStream.js`)**
- Add imports for TipButton and LiveTipsOverlay
- Add socket room join/leave logic
- Add components to JSX

### 3. Run Migration (1 minute)

```bash
cd backend
psql $DATABASE_URL -f migrations/009_create_pro_monetization.sql
```

### 4. Test & Deploy

Follow testing checklist in `PRO_MONETIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## 📊 System Architecture

### Session Types

```
public broadcast     -> sessionType: 'broadcast_public'  (free, tipping enabled)
private broadcast    -> sessionType: 'broadcast_private' (ticket required, tipping enabled)
private call (1:1)   -> sessionType: 'call_2way'         (PPM billing, tipping enabled)
```

### Token Flow

```
USER BUYS TOKENS (Revenue Source for Digis)
  → User pays $9.99 → Gets 100 tokens
  → Digis cost: ~$0.05 (5 cents)
  → Digis margin: $9.94 per purchase ✅

FAN purchases TICKET (500 tokens)
  → Fan wallet: -500 tokens
  → Creator wallet: +500 tokens (100%)
  → Platform fee: 0 tokens
  → billing_events: 2 records (fan charge, creator payout)

FAN in PPM CALL (30s block @ 100 tokens/min)
  → Every 30s: Fan -50 tokens, Creator +50 tokens (100%)
  → If fan balance < 50: Call auto-ends
  → billing_events: Continuous records every 30s
  → Platform fee: 0 tokens

FAN sends TIP (250 tokens)
  → Fan wallet: -250 tokens
  → Creator wallet: +250 tokens (100%)
  → Platform fee: 0 tokens
  → Socket broadcast to all viewers in channel
  → LiveTipsOverlay shows animated bubble

CREATOR CASHES OUT
  → Creator has 100 tokens → Gets $5.00 USD
  → Payout rate: 1 token = $0.05 (5 cents)
```

### Revenue Model

**Creator Earnings**: 100% of all tokens spent on them
**Platform Revenue**: Token sales markup only

**Business Model**:
- **Digis makes money when users BUY tokens** (not when they spend)
- Token purchase example: $9.99 → 100 tokens (cost ~$0.05, margin $9.94)
- Creator gets 100% of tokens spent on them
- Creator payout: 1 token = $0.05 USD

**Implementation**:
- Tips: `/backend/routes/tips.js` (creatorCut = amount, platformFee = 0)
- Tickets: `/backend/routes/streams.js` (creatorCut = priceTokens, platformFee = 0)
- PPM: `/backend/services/billing.js` (creatorCut = blockCost, platformFee = 0)

**Key Advantage**: Most creator-friendly platform in the market - creators keep 100%
