  <h1>CreatorCard Navigation Test</h1>
  <p>Open your browser console (F12) and click on a creator card on the Explore page.</p>
  <p>Look for these logs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>üîç CreatorCard clicked:</strong> - Shows click was detected</li>
    <li><strong>‚úÖ Navigating to:</strong> - Shows navigation was triggered</li>
    <li><strong>[VanityRoute] Username:</strong> - Shows VanityRoute received the username</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Issues:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>No logs at all</strong> - Click is being blocked by a button/form element</li>
    <li><strong>Logs show but no navigation</strong> - profilePath is null or navigation is failing</li>
    <li><strong>[VanityRoute] says "Invalid format"</strong> - Username has invalid characters or length</li>
    <li><strong>[VanityRoute] says "Reserved word"</strong> - Username conflicts with a route</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Quick Fix:</h2>
  <p>If you see "Invalid format", check the username in the database. It must be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3-30 characters</li>
    <li>Only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, underscores, hyphens</li>
    <li>Start and end with alphanumeric</li>
  </ul>
