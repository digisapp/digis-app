# Route Migration Plan - App.js to AppRoutes

## Status: Pending Implementation

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the current `currentView` state-based routing system to the URL-based `AppRoutes` component.

## Current State

### App.js Routing (~600 lines, lines 1224-1764)

**Current Implementation**:
```javascript
const [currentView, setCurrentView] = useState('explore');

// URL ⇄ view syncing (lines 223-252)
useEffect(() => {
  const pathToView = {
    '/': 'home',
    '/dashboard': 'dashboard',
    '/explore': 'explore',
    // ... 30+ more mappings
  };
  const view = pathToView[location.pathname];
  if (view) {
    setCurrentView(view);
  }
}, [location.pathname]);

// Conditional rendering based on currentView
{currentView === 'dashboard' ? (
  <DashboardRouter />
) : currentView === 'explore' ? (
  <ExplorePage />
) : currentView === 'messages' ? (
  <MessagesPage />
) : // ... 30+ more conditions
}
```

### AppRoutes.jsx (Complete and Ready)

**Target Implementation**:
```javascript
import AppRoutes from './routes/AppRoutes';

// Single line replaces 600+ lines
<AppRoutes />
```

## Why This Migration Is Complex

1. **State Synchronization**: Multiple components use `setCurrentView` to navigate (30+ call sites)
2. **Navigation Hooks**: Custom navigation logic throughout the app needs conversion to `useNavigate()`
3. **URL Format Changes**: Some URLs may need to change (e.g., `/creator/:id` vs `/creator?id=...`)
4. **Protected Routes**: Authentication checks are currently inline, need to use `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper
5. **Mobile/Desktop Routing**: Device-specific rendering is currently mixed with view logic
6. **Deep Links**: Direct URL access may behave differently than state-based navigation
7. **Testing Surface**: 30+ routes need individual testing for regressions

## Migration Strategy (Recommended: Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: Preparation (Before Migration)
- [ ] Audit all `setCurrentView` usage locations (~30+ sites)
- [ ] Document current URL structure and routing behavior
- [ ] Create test cases for each route
- [ ] Ensure all context migrations are stable

### Phase 2: Code Changes
- [ ] Remove `currentView` state and related effects (~100 lines)
- [ ] Replace conditional rendering block with `<AppRoutes />` (~600 lines)
- [ ] Replace all `setCurrentView` calls with `navigate()` calls
- [ ] Update navigation components to use `<Link>` or `navigate()`
- [ ] Remove URL syncing effects

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Test all 30+ routes individually
- [ ] Test protected routes (authentication required)
- [ ] Test role-based routing (creator/admin/fan)
- [ ] Test mobile vs desktop routing
- [ ] Test direct URL access
- [ ] Test browser back/forward navigation
- [ ] Test deep linking

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove unused navigation utilities
- [ ] Remove old route mapping objects
- [ ] Update documentation

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files
1. **src/App.js** - Remove currentView state and conditional rendering
2. **src/components/navigation/*.jsx** - Update navigation components to use React Router
3. **All components using setCurrentView** - Replace with `useNavigate()`

### Reference Files
- **src/routes/AppRoutes.jsx** - Already complete, no changes needed
- **src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx** - Already provides auth state for protected routes
- **src/contexts/DeviceContext.jsx** - Already provides device detection for responsive routing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Breaking navigation**: Users unable to navigate the app
- **Broken deep links**: Direct URLs not working
- **Auth routing loops**: Protected routes not working correctly

### Medium Risk
- **Mobile rendering issues**: Device-specific routes not rendering correctly
- **State persistence**: Losing navigation state on refresh

### Low Risk
- **URL format changes**: Can be mitigated with redirects
- **Performance**: AppRoutes uses lazy loading, should be faster

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Paths
- [ ] Home → Explore → Creator Profile
- [ ] Login → Dashboard → Settings
- [ ] Creator Application Flow
- [ ] Token Purchase Flow
- [ ] Video Call Flow
- [ ] Messages → Conversation

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Unauthenticated user accessing protected route
- [ ] Creator accessing admin-only route
- [ ] Fan accessing creator-only route
- [ ] Direct URL access with no session
- [ ] Browser back/forward after navigation
- [ ] Refresh on protected route

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after migration:

1. **Immediate**: Revert `src/App.js` to previous version
2. **Quick Fix**: Use git to restore previous working state
3. **Gradual Rollback**: Keep `currentView` alongside AppRoutes during transition period

## Code Examples

### Before: Navigation with setCurrentView
```javascript
<button onClick={() => setCurrentView('explore')}>
  Explore
</button>
```

### After: Navigation with React Router
```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();

<button onClick={() => navigate('/explore')}>
  Explore
</button>
```

### Before: Conditional Rendering
```javascript
{currentView === 'explore' && <ExplorePage />}
```

### After: Route Definition (in AppRoutes.jsx)
```javascript
<Route path="/explore" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    {isMobile ? <MobileExplore /> : <ExplorePage />}
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

## Expected Benefits After Migration

1. **Reduced Code**: Remove ~600 lines from App.js
2. **Better UX**: Proper browser back/forward support
3. **SEO**: Better URL structure for search engines
4. **Maintainability**: Routes defined in one place
5. **Type Safety**: Easier to add TypeScript route typing
6. **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting

## Timeline Estimate

- **Preparation**: 2-3 hours (auditing, documentation)
- **Implementation**: 4-6 hours (code changes)
- **Testing**: 6-8 hours (comprehensive testing)
- **Total**: 12-17 hours of focused work

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete current migration testing** - Validate auth, device, modal, and socket migrations
2. **Fix any issues found** - Ensure stable foundation
3. **Plan dedicated time** - Route migration needs uninterrupted focus
4. **Create feature branch** - Allow easy rollback if needed
5. **Test incrementally** - Don't merge until all tests pass

## Notes

- This migration should be done in a single focused session to avoid partial state
- Consider doing this migration during low-traffic hours
- Have a rollback plan ready
- Monitor error logs closely after deployment
