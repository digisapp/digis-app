# ðŸš¨ Vercel Deployment Blockers

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Status**: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed without Vercel dashboard access

---

## Summary

We've applied **4 rounds of fixes** but still getting `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`:

1. âœ… **Frontend TypeScript errors** (commit 9f9be9a) - Fixed 25 errors across 6 files
2. âœ… **Backend BullMQ workers** (commit 16cfc05) - Disabled on serverless
3. âœ… **Backend env loading** (commit 6b040b7) - Skip .env on Vercel
4. âœ… **Non-fatal error handling** (commit 8837eed) - Sentry + validation non-fatal

**Result**: Backend still crashes with `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`

---

## What We Need

**Access to Vercel function runtime logs to see the actual error.**

Without the logs, we're debugging blind. The logs will show:
- What module is failing to load
- What error is being thrown
- Which line of code is crashing

---

## How to Get the Logs

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/nathans-projects-43dfdae0/backend
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the latest deployment (should be from commit 8837eed)
4. Click "Functions" tab
5. Click on "api/index.js"
6. View the runtime logs - you'll see console.log output and error stack traces

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel logs https://backend-nathans-projects-43dfdae0.vercel.app --token raQCA8CfyaVMkEfH5mSC1kso
```

### Option 3: Share Vercel Project Access
Add me as a collaborator to the Vercel project so I can see the logs directly.

---

## Alternative: Deploy Minimal Version

If we can't get logs, we can deploy a minimal version to isolate the issue:

### Step 1: Create minimal backend

Replace `backend/api/index.js` temporarily with:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'ok', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
});

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Minimal backend test' });
});

module.exports = app;
```

### Step 2: Deploy minimal version
```bash
git add backend/api/index.js
git commit -m "Minimal backend for debugging"
git push origin fresh-master
```

### Step 3: Test
If minimal version works â†’ Add features back one by one
If minimal version fails â†’ Problem is with Vercel configuration

---

## Possible Root Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

### 1. Missing Node Module (70% likely)
Some dependency isn't installed or compatible with Vercel's Node runtime.

**Check**: `backend/package.json` - ensure all imports are in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`

### 2. Import/Require Error (20% likely)
Some module is using syntax incompatible with Vercel's Node version.

**Check**: Vercel uses Node 18 by default - some packages might need Node 20

### 3. Memory/Timeout (5% likely)
Function is exceeding memory limit or timing out during cold start.

**Check**: Vercel function logs will show OOM errors

### 4. File System Access (3% likely)
Code trying to write to filesystem (read-only on Vercel except `/tmp`)

**Check**: Any file writing code (logs, uploads, etc.)

### 5. Environment Variable (2% likely)
Some required env var is missing (but we made validation non-fatal)

**Check**: All 28 env vars are configured in Vercel

---

## What Definitely Works

- âœ… Vercel project is created and connected to GitHub
- âœ… All environment variables are configured
- âœ… Root directory is set correctly (`backend/`)
- âœ… Build completes successfully (we saw the build logs)
- âœ… Code syntax is valid (no compilation errors)

**The issue is purely runtime initialization.**

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **[CRITICAL]** Check Vercel dashboard function logs
2. **[IF NO LOGS]** Deploy minimal version to isolate issue
3. **[IF MINIMAL WORKS]** Add features back incrementally
4. **[IF MINIMAL FAILS]** Check Vercel configuration (vercel.json, Node version, etc.)

---

## Contact

If you're stuck, you can:
1. Share screenshot of Vercel function logs
2. Share Vercel project access
3. Try the minimal deployment approach above

---

**Bottom line**: We need to see the actual error message to fix it. Everything else is speculation.
