## Part 2: Prepare Your Project

### Step 1: Install Required Tools
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Verify installation
vercel --version
```

### Step 2: Prepare Environment Variables
1. In your project folder, find the file `.env.example`
2. Create a new file called `.env.local` 
3. Copy everything from `.env.example` to `.env.local`
4. You'll need to get real values for these (we'll help you below)

## Part 3: Deploy Using Vercel CLI (Easiest Method)

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Project Folder
```bash
# Make sure you're in the digis-app folder
cd /Users/examodels/Desktop/digis-app
```

### Step 2: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
- Enter the email you used to sign up
- Check your email for verification
- Click the verification link

### Step 3: Deploy the Backend
```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Start deployment
vercel

# Answer the prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy "./backend"? [Y/n]: Y
# ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? Select your username
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N]: n
# ? What's your project's name? digis-backend
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./ (just press Enter)
# ? Want to modify these settings? [y/N]: n
```

**IMPORTANT**: After deployment completes, you'll see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ Production: https://digis-backend-xxxxx.vercel.app [copied to clipboard]
```
**SAVE THIS URL!** You'll need it for the frontend.

### Step 4: Deploy the Frontend
```bash
# Go back to main folder
cd ..

# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Start deployment
vercel

# Answer the prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy "./frontend"? [Y/n]: Y
# ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? Select your username
# ? Link to existing project? [y/N]: n
# ? What's your project's name? digis-frontend
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./ (just press Enter)
# ? Want to modify these settings? [y/N]: n
```
