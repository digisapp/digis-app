# Login Infinite Loading Fix - Summary

## Problem
After successful login, the page showed an infinite loading spinner with nothing in the console.

## Root Cause
Your app has **two separate authentication systems** that were not synchronized:

### 1. Auth.js Component
- Handles the login form UI
- Calls Supabase auth
- Calls `onLogin()` callback with user data
- Updates **HybridStore** (legacy state management)

### 2. AuthContext.jsx
- Centralized authentication context
- Manages `authLoading` state
- Used by App.js to show/hide loading screen
- Has its own separate `user` and `profile` state

### The Disconnect
1. User logs in via Auth.js
2. Auth.js calls `onLogin()` which updates **HybridStore**
3. BUT `AuthContext.authLoading` stays `true` forever
4. App.js checks: `if (authLoading) return <LoadingScreen />`
5. **Result: Infinite loading**

## The Fix

### File 1: `/frontend/src/App.js`
**What changed:**
- Added `setUser: authSetUser` and `setProfile: authSetProfile` to `useAuth()` hook
- Updated both Desktop and Mobile `onLogin` handlers to call:
  - `authSetProfile(profileData)` - updates AuthContext profile
  - `authSetUser({ id, email })` - updates AuthContext user

**Why:** This synchronizes the legacy HybridStore updates with the new AuthContext, so AuthContext knows when login completes.

### File 2: `/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
**What changed:**
- Added `useEffect` that watches `user` and `profile`
- When both are set, automatically calls `setAuthLoading(false)`

**Why:** This ensures that manual login flows (like Auth.js) properly stop the loading state.

### File 3: `/frontend/src/components/Auth.js`
**What changed:**
- Added 100ms delay before navigation after calling `onLogin()`

**Why:** Gives React time to process state updates before navigating, preventing race conditions.

## Testing
1. Try logging in with an existing account
2. The loading screen should disappear after login
3. You should be redirected to your dashboard/explore page
4. Check console - you should see:
   - `âœ… AuthContext: User and profile set, stopping loading`
   - Desktop/Mobile login success messages

## Future Recommendation
Consider migrating fully to `AuthContext` and removing `HybridStore` auth logic to have a single source of truth.
