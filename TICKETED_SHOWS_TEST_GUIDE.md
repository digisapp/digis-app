## Test Flow 7: Analytics Verification

### Creator Analytics Should Show:

- Total revenue in tokens
- Peak concurrent viewers
- Average watch time
- Early bird vs regular sales

## Socket Events to Monitor

Use browser DevTools to verify these events:

### Emitted Events:
- `ticketed_show_announced`
- `private_mode_started`
- `ticket_purchased`
- `enable_private_video`
- `private_show_ended`

### Rooms:
- `stream:{streamId}` - For all stream participants
- `user:{userId}` - For individual notifications

## Database Verification

Check these tables after testing:

```sql
-- Check active shows
SELECT * FROM ticketed_shows WHERE stream_id = 'YOUR_STREAM_ID';

-- Check ticket purchases
SELECT * FROM show_tickets WHERE show_id = 'YOUR_SHOW_ID';

-- Check analytics
SELECT * FROM show_analytics WHERE show_id = 'YOUR_SHOW_ID';

-- Verify token transactions
SELECT * FROM tokens 
WHERE transaction_type IN ('show_ticket_purchase', 'show_ticket_revenue')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"
**Solution:** Ensure streamId is passed correctly to PrivateShowAnnouncement component

### Issue: Video not hiding for non-ticket holders
**Solution:** 
1. Check socket connection is established
2. Verify `hasAccess` prop is passed to VideoCall
3. Check Agora role is set correctly

### Issue: Tokens not deducting
**Solution:**
1. Verify user has sufficient balance
2. Check database transaction is atomic
3. Ensure both deduction and credit happen

### Issue: Real-time updates not working
**Solution:**
1. Check WebSocket connection
2. Verify socket rooms are joined correctly
3. Check backend is emitting events

## Performance Testing

### Load Test:
1. Have 10+ viewers join stream
2. Multiple simultaneous ticket purchases
3. Monitor:
   - Response times
   - Socket message delivery
   - Database transaction speed

### Stress Points:
- Concurrent ticket purchases
- Large number of viewers
- Rapid show start/stop cycles
- Network interruptions
