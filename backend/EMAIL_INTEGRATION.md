## Integration Points

### Authentication Flow (`/backend/routes/auth.js`)
```javascript
// Welcome emails sent on user creation
if (accountType === 'creator') {
  sendCreatorWelcomeEmail(email, username);
} else {
  sendFanWelcomeEmail(email, username);
}
```

### Admin Flow (`/backend/routes/admin.js`)
```javascript
// Creator approval email
sendCreatorApprovalEmail(email, creatorName);
```

## Testing Emails

To test the email service:
```bash
cd backend
node testEmail.js
```

## Configuration

Environment variables in `.env`:
```
POSTMARK_API_KEY=your-api-key
POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL=team@digis.cc
EMAIL_ENABLED=true
```

## Important Notes

1. **Non-blocking**: All emails are sent asynchronously to not block user actions
2. **Error Handling**: Email failures are logged but don't fail the main operation
3. **Anti-spam**: Only essential emails are sent, no transaction notifications
4. **Testing**: Use `testEmail.js` to verify email functionality
5. **Branding**: All emails include the Digis logo (`digis-logo-black.png`) hosted at https://digis.cc/
6. **Logo Requirements**: Ensure the logo files are accessible at your domain for proper display in emails
