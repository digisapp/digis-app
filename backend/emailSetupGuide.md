### 📁 Files Created:
1. `/backend/services/emailService.js` - Main email service with all templates
2. `/backend/testEmail.js` - Test script to verify email functionality
3. Updated `/backend/.env` - Added Postmark configuration

### ⚠️ Important Note About Inactive Recipients:

The error message about "inactive addresses" means that team@digis.cc has been suppressed in Postmark. This can happen when:
1. The email bounced (domain not properly configured)
2. It was marked as spam
3. It was manually suppressed for testing

### 🔧 To Fix the Inactive Address Issue:

1. **Log into your Postmark account**
2. **Go to Suppressions → Bounces**
3. **Search for team@digis.cc**
4. **Remove it from the suppression list**
5. **Also check:**
   - Suppressions → Spam Complaints
   - Suppressions → Manual Suppressions

### 📋 Integration Checklist:

- [x] Postmark package installed
- [x] Email service module created
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Email templates created (Welcome, Password Reset, etc.)
- [x] Test script created
- [ ] Remove team@digis.cc from Postmark suppressions
- [ ] Integrate with user registration flow
- [ ] Integrate with password reset flow
- [ ] Integrate with payment flow

### 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Clear the suppression** in Postmark dashboard
2. **Test with a different email** if needed:
   ```bash
   node -e "
   const { sendEmail } = require('./services/emailService');
   sendEmail('your-test-email@gmail.com', 'Test', '<h1>Test Email</h1>')
     .then(() => console.log('✅ Sent!'))
     .catch(e => console.error(e));
   "
   ```

3. **Integrate into your routes**, for example in `/backend/routes/auth.js`:
   ```javascript
   const { sendWelcomeEmail } = require('../services/emailService');

   // In your registration endpoint
   router.post('/register', async (req, res) => {
     // ... user creation logic

     // Send welcome email
     try {
       await sendWelcomeEmail(user.email, user.username);
     } catch (emailError) {
       console.error('Email failed:', emailError);
       // Don't block registration if email fails
     }
   });
   ```

### 🌟 Production Considerations:

1. **Domain Verification**: Make sure digis.cc is verified in Postmark
2. **SPF/DKIM Records**: Add these to your DNS for better deliverability
3. **Rate Limits**: Postmark has sending limits based on your plan
4. **Monitoring**: Set up webhooks to track bounces and complaints
5. **Templates**: Consider using Postmark's template system for more complex emails

Your email service is ready to use! Just clear the suppression and you're good to go. 🚀
