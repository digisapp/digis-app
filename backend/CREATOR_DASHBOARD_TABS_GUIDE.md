## Tab Breakdown

### 1. üì∏ **Photos Tab**
**Purpose:** Manage and monetize photo content

**What Creators Can Do:**
- Upload photos (JPG, PNG)
- Set photos as **Premium/PPV** (Pay-Per-View)
- Price individual photos with tokens
- View photo analytics (views, likes, earnings)
- Edit photo details (title, description, price)
- Delete photos
- Track which fans have purchased each photo

**Business Logic:**
- Photos can be **FREE** (visible to all followers)
- Photos can be **PREMIUM** (locked behind a token payment)
- Creators earn tokens when fans unlock premium photos
- Photos appear blurred for fans who haven't purchased them
- Analytics show earnings per photo

**Use Case Example:**
> A fitness creator uploads exclusive workout photos. Free photos show exercises in regular gym attire, while premium photos ($5-10 tokens) show detailed form breakdowns or behind-the-scenes content.

### 2. üé• **Videos Tab**
**Purpose:** Upload and sell video content

**What Creators Can Do:**
- Upload videos (MP4, MOV)
- Set video pricing (PPV model)
- Add thumbnails
- Set video duration
- Track video views and purchases
- Edit/delete videos
- See earnings per video

**Business Logic:**
- Videos can be free previews or full premium content
- Locked videos show thumbnail with play button + lock icon
- Fans pay tokens to unlock full video access
- Once purchased, fans own permanent access
- Videos show duration and viewer count

**Use Case Example:**
> A chef creator posts free 30-second recipe teasers, but full 10-minute cooking tutorials cost 20 tokens. Fans who purchase get lifetime access.

### 3. üì° **Streams Tab**
**Purpose:** Manage live streams and VOD (Video on Demand)

**What Creators Can Do:**
- View past live stream recordings
- Set pricing for stream recordings (VOD)
- Schedule upcoming streams
- Track stream analytics (viewers, duration, earnings)
- Delete old streams
- Manage ticketed shows

**Business Logic:**
- **Live Streams:** Real-time broadcasts (managed separately in "Go Live")
- **Stream Recordings:** After going live, streams are saved here
- Recordings can be monetized as VOD content
- Shows "LIVE" badge for active streams
- Shows viewer count and earnings
- Can set stream recordings as free or premium

**Use Case Example:**
> A gaming creator streams live gameplay. After the stream ends, the recording is automatically saved to this tab. They set it as premium (15 tokens) so fans who missed it can watch later.

### 4. üéÅ **Offers Tab**
**Purpose:** Create custom service offerings

**What Creators Can Do:**
- Create custom offers/services
- Set offer details:
  - Title (e.g., "Personalized Video Message")
  - Description
  - Category (General, Coaching, etc.)
  - Price in tokens
  - Delivery time (1 hour - 1 week)
  - Max quantity (limited slots)
- Edit/delete offers
- Track offer bookings and earnings

**Business Logic:**
- Offers are **SERVICES**, not physical/digital products
- Examples: personalized shoutouts, coaching calls, custom content requests
- Fans purchase slots, creators deliver within promised timeframe
- Max quantity creates scarcity (e.g., "Only 5 slots available")
- Active/inactive status control

**Use Case Example:**
> A musician offers "Custom Song Request" for 100 tokens. Description says they'll create a 30-second personalized jingle. Delivery time is 3 days. Limited to 10 requests per month.

**What Creators Can Do:**
- Upload digital files (PDFs, eBooks, presets, templates, audio files)
- Set pricing for digital downloads
- Add preview images
- Track downloads and sales
- Edit/delete digital products
- See earnings per product

**Business Logic:**
- **Digitals** are downloadable files fans can keep
- Different from photos/videos (which are viewable in-app)
- Examples: Lightroom presets, workout PDFs, music stems, design templates
- Fans pay once, download unlimited times
- Shows download count

**Use Case Example:**
> A photographer sells "Wedding Photography Preset Pack" (20 Lightroom presets) for 50 tokens. Buyers download a ZIP file they can use in their own photo editing.

  - Product images (multiple)
  - Digital/physical flag

- Stock management (products can sell out)
- Multiple images per product
- Active/inactive status
