- [x] Navigation switches between creator/fan
- [x] Quick actions are clickable
- [x] Stats display correctly
- [x] Scrolling works smoothly
- [x] Safe areas respect device boundaries
- [x] Animations are smooth (60fps)

## Browser Compatibility
- Safari iOS 15+
- Chrome Android 100+
- Firefox Mobile 100+
