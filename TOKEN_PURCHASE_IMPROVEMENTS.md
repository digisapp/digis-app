# Token Purchase Component Improvements

## Summary of Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Endpoint Mismatch ✅
- Changed from `/api/payments/create-intent` to `/api/tokens/purchase`
- Now correctly matches the backend endpoint defined in `tokens.js`

### 2. Added Network Resilience ✅
- Integrated `fetchWithRetry` utility for automatic retry on network failures
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Handles transient network errors gracefully

### 3. Enhanced Payment Flow ✅
- Updated to match backend response structure (`success`, `paymentIntent`, `transaction`)
- Proper handling of 3D Secure authentication (`requires_action`, `requires_confirmation`)
- Added toast notifications for successful purchases
- Better error handling with detailed messages

### 4. Added Prop Validation ✅
- Validates `user.id` exists before rendering
- Validates `giftRecipient.uid` when in gift mode
- Checks for required environment variables (Stripe key, Backend URL)
- Shows user-friendly error messages for configuration issues

### 5. Improved Accessibility ✅
- Added `aria-label` and `aria-pressed` to package selection cards
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space keys) for package selection
- Proper `htmlFor` attribute on form labels
- Added `id` to CardElement for label association
- Memoized PackageCard component for better performance

## Environment Variables Required

```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.digis.app
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Network errors will retry automatically, reducing failed purchases
2. **Security**: Proper 3D Secure handling ensures compliance with SCA regulations
3. **UX**: Clear error messages and toast notifications improve user experience
4. **Performance**: Memoized components reduce unnecessary re-renders
5. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard users can now purchase tokens

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with network throttling to verify retry logic
2. Use Stripe test cards for 3D Secure flows
3. Test keyboard navigation through package selection
4. Verify error messages with missing environment variables
5. Test gift flow with valid/invalid recipients
